Hapi.js-Mongoose-Angular Skeleton
================================================

The purpose of this app is to prepare a basic Skeleton for a node.js project and show a new way to work with Hapi.js, Mongodb, Mongoose, Angular.js.

This gives a quick start for a node.js industrial project without worrying much on structure but focus more on business logic.

It has only basic modules to start a new project from scratch and later add few advance module when needed.

Now it's time to start coding...

Happy Coding!
